## Background Information

I play a data analyst for an organization that creates Android and iOS mobile apps.

English-speaking population. We also generate income via in-app advertisements, so the more time users spend using the app, the more money we make.
The developer team has asked the data analyst team to examine the platform's data in order to gain knowledge and offer suggestions about the development of the
following applications.
